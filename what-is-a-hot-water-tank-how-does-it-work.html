How does it work?</h2><p>A hot water tank's purpose is, as mentioned, to heat and store water for use in the home. All tanks come with water supply pipes and delivery pipes. The intake pipe, also known as the supply pipe, allows water to be drawn from your house to flow into the tank through a "dip tub." Meanwhile, the delivery pipe heats the water and distributes it to hot water outlets.</p><p>As hot water flows out of the tank through the top, your tank automatically refills with cold water at the bottom, which is then heated and stored for future use. This cycle will continue as long as the tank is in good condition.</p><p>In order to effectively store heated water for an extended amount of time, hot water tanks have built-in thermal insulation which reduces standby heat loss. Since hot water is not constantly in use, it is very important to make sure the tank you choose has adequate thermal insulation to ensure hot water is available whenever you need it. The tank's interior is lined with glass to protect against corrosion, as hot water tanks are constructed of steel.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.weather-tech.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rheem-water-heater-300x219.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Hot Water Tank Winnipeg" data-cke-saved-src=" https://www.weather-tech.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rheem-water-heater-300x219.png"></p><h2>It's better to rent from Enercare</h2><p>Our Enercare AdvantageTM Rental Program includes free installation and coverage for any repairs that occur over the lifetime of the equipment**.
